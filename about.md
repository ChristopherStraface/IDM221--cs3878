### Home 
Hello, my name is Christopher Straface, and I am a UXID major at Drexel University. Please look through my portfolio for more information about me and my work.

### About
*Background:*
I was born in Philadelphia and have lived here all my life. I’m a creative mind who likes to take things slow and peacefully, and I love animals. When it was time for me to apply for universities, I was unsure of where I wanted to go or what I wanted to do. Drexel’s opportunities stuck out to someone like me, and it was during my first year I discovered my love for learning design, and found a place in the UXID major.

*Experience:*  
I have two years of experience taking courses in design and working on different design projects, ranging in scope from proof of concepts to full interactable designs and web pages

*Goals:*
My goal is to learn more about the world through design. I love to create designs because I find it to be a wonderful expression of creativity, and a way to expand my thinking in unique ways to accommodate for different people. It’s a gateway to learn more about people all while creating something new and unique, and I love being able to make something new and impactful

### Featured Work 
*YouTube Redesign:*  
I created an interactable redesign for the YouTube mobile app which reconstructures the main pages while also making new additions with the intent of bettering the full experience. This project was created to explore creating new interfaces for a familiar application

*New Discord-Inspired Interface:*
I created a full, interactable interface for a new mobile app called “frctzn” (pronounced like “friction”), which is heavily based on Discord. This is a project not intended to become a full product, but a way to test animations and create new assets and interfaces
