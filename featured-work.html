            <h2>YouTube Redesign:</h2>
            <p>I created an interactable redesign for the YouTube mobile app which reconstructures the main pages while also making new additions with the intent of bettering the full experience. This project was created to explore creating new interfaces for a familiar application</p>

            <h3>New Discord-Inspired Interface:</h3>
            <p>I created a full, interactable interface for a new mobile app called “frctzn” (pronounced like “friction”), which is heavily based on Discord. This is a project not intended to become a full product, but a way to test animations and create new assets and interfaces</p>

            <h4>Partial interface design for new website:</h4>
            <p>I contributed to the front end design for portions of a project that involved creating a new social media website. This project was only a proof of concept and not fully expanded upon, but still showcases design elements I created</p>
