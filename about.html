            <h2>Background:</h2>
            <p>I was born in Philadelphia and have lived here all my life. I’m a creative mind who likes to take things slow and peacefully, and I love animals. When it was time for me to apply for universities, I was unsure of where I wanted to go or what I wanted to do. Drexel’s opportunities stuck out to someone like me, and it was during my first year I discovered my love for learning design, and found a place in the UXID major.</p>

        <div id="experience">
            <h3>Experience:</h3>
            <p>I have two years of experience taking courses in design and working on different design projects, ranging in scope from proof of concepts to full interactable designs and web pages.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="goals">
            <h4>Goals:</h4>
            <p>My goal is to learn more about the world through design. I love to create designs because I find it to be a wonderful expression of creativity, and a way to expand my thinking in unique ways to accommodate for different people. It’s a gateway to learn more about people all while creating something new and unique, and I love being able to make something new and impactful.</p>
